The simulation results are compared to simulations with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS). We are particularly interested in SUMMAâ€™s capability to mimic model behaviors of the other two models through the selection of appropriate model parameterizations in SUMMA.

## 1 Introduction
Hydrologic modeling involves a series of decisions made by the model developers, ranging from data preparation, conceptulization, and numerical solutions and so on [@clark_unified_2015]. 
Though these decisions are such important that can greatly impact or even determine the modeling performance, besides data limitation and modeling purposes, these decisions made by hydrologic model developers are also largely dependent on model developers' intuition and previous experience. Therefore, a variety of models have been developed in the past few decades. On one hand, they provide options for particular modeling area and purpose. 
On the other hand, testing model decisions is made an emerging enormous challenge in hydrologic modeling as data, process rerpersentation, and numeirc methods have been becoming increasingly available.
This underlines the need of a tool that can provide flexibility of specifying different model decisions such as process representation, spatial architecture and numerical solver. 

The Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) model was developed by Clark et al [@clark_unified_2015; -@clark_unified_2015-1] for tackling such chanllenges. purpose. general apporach

SUMMA has been under active ongoing development by the developer team. what have done (applications in clark2015a,b) . only point/field application [@clark_unified_2015-1]. It is important to evaluate the capability of SUMMA for large domain applications. Particularly, we are interested in SUMMA's flexibility of spatial 

In this study, our objective is to demonstrate the first long-term and large-domain application of SUMMA, specifically to the Columbia River Basin (CRB), as well as the flexibility of SUMMA in a real case study. The CRB model is driven by the daily forcing data developed by blivneh (**CITE** 2013) for the simulation period between 1915 and 2011. The CRB is discretized into a 1/16 cell-based grid as well as a HRU-based grid. `**TODO** the options are used to test its impact on the runoff?/snow?`. A brief introduction of SUMMA is given in Section 2. The data and model . The simulated results are compared to the observations and

In the CRB model, the land cover distribution is specified based on the 2001 National Land Cover Database developed by @homer_completion_2007. In the CRB, there are primarily **n** different types of land covers (figure **N**). The majority of the basin is covered by (used for) **TYPE**.

#### 2.2.2 Forcing Data
The atmospheric forcing data for driving SUMMA include precipitation, air temperature, air pressure, specific humidity, wind speed, incoming shortwave and longwave radiations. The time step of the forcing data is artitrary but in this study, an hourly time step is used. The hourly forcing data is derived from a 1/16 degree forcing data set, including the daily precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature as well as wind speed developed by @livneh_long-term_2013. The daily forcing dataset is further disaggregated to an hourly intervel using the Mountain MicroClimate simulator (MTCLIM) [@united_states_department_of_agriculture_forest_service_mtclim:_1989; @kimball_improved_1997; @thornton_improved_1999]. Meanwhile, the hourly air pressure, specific humidity, and incoming shortwave and longwave radiation are also derived by MTCLIM. For the HRU-based discritization, the forcing data are averaged based on their areas interceted with the HRUs.



#### 2.2.3 Model Experiment
In this study, two modeling experiments are conducted with SUMMA. These two expriments are used to test the fexibility of SUMMA in differnt aspects naming the spatial structure and process parameterization, respectively. 

In the first experiment, the CRB is discretized into a 1/16 degree grid and a hru-based grid. The 1/16 degree cell-based grid is aligned with the grid used by Blinved's. There are 23XXX active grid cells in the CRB. The cell-based grids are the primari spatial structure used in land surface models (**CITE**: refs like CLM) and hydrologic models (**CITE**: refs like DHSVM). The advantage of cell-based grids are 1. easy to develop 2. most used format in many data (**CITE**: refs like NLDAS). On the other hand, a HRU-bsed grid is developed baed on United State Geologic Survey Geospatial Fabric [@viger_gis_2014; @roland_j._viger_preliminary_2014]. AS a result, there are 11723 HRUs in the CRB. The HRU-bsed grid is another popular discritization used in many other hydrologic models (**CITE**: refs like USGS Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) or SWAT). It assumes that hydrologic features such as the land cover, topography, and subsurface characteristics are uniformly distributed in the HRU unit. The HRU-based grid is superior to the cell-based grid in more precise representation of hydrologic characteristics.

`**TODO**: discuss with Martyn on what modeling decision to test in CRB (snow melt?)`
