	abstract = {This work advances a unified approach to process-based hydrologic modeling to enable controlled and systematic evaluation of multiple model representations (hypotheses) of hydrologic processes and scaling behavior. Our approach, which we term the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives ({SUMMA}), formulates a general set of conservation equations, providing the flexibility to experiment with different spatial representations, different flux parameterizations, different model parameter values, and different time stepping schemes. In this paper, we introduce the general approach used in {SUMMA}, detailing the spatial organization and model simplifications, and how different representations of multiple physical processes can be combined within a single modeling framework. We discuss how {SUMMA} can be used to systematically pursue the method of multiple working hypotheses in hydrology. In particular, we discuss how {SUMMA} can help tackle major hydrologic modeling challenges, including defining the appropriate complexity of a model, selecting among competing flux parameterizations, representing spatial variability across a hierarchy of scales, identifying potential improvements in computational efficiency and numerical accuracy as part of the numerical solver, and improving understanding of the various sources of model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {A major neglected weakness of many current hydrological models is the numerical method used to solve the governing model equations. This paper thoroughly evaluates several classes of time stepping schemes in terms of numerical reliability and computational efficiency in the context of conceptual hydrological modeling. Numerical experiments are carried out using 8 distinct time stepping algorithms and 6 different conceptual rainfall-runoff models, applied in a densely gauged experimental catchment, as well as in 12 basins with diverse physical and hydroclimatic characteristics. Results show that, over vast regions of the parameter space, the numerical errors of fixed-step explicit schemes commonly used in hydrology routinely dwarf the structural errors of the model conceptualization. This substantially degrades model predictions, but also, disturbingly, generates fortuitously adequate performance for parameter sets where numerical errors compensate for model structural errors. Simply running fixed-step explicit schemes with shorter time steps provides a poor balance between accuracy and efficiency: in some cases daily-step adaptive explicit schemes with moderate error tolerances achieved comparable or higher accuracy than 15 min fixed-step explicit approximations but were nearly 10 times more efficient. From the range of simple time stepping schemes investigated in this work, the fixed-step implicit Euler method and the adaptive explicit Heun method emerge as good practical choices for the majority of simulation scenarios. In combination with the companion paper, where impacts on model analysis, interpretation, and prediction are assessed, this two-part study vividly highlights the impact of numerical errors on critical performance aspects of conceptual hydrological models and provides practical guidelines for robust numerical implementation.},

	abstract = {This study presents quantitative and qualitative insights into the time scale dependencies of hydrological parameters, predictions and their uncertainties, and examines the impact of the time resolution of the calibration data on the identifiable system complexity. Data from an experimental basin (Weierbach, Luxembourg) is used to analyze four conceptual models of varying complexity, over time scales of 30 min to 3 days, using several combinations of numerical implementations and inference equations. Large spurious time scale trends arise in the parameter estimates when unreliable time-stepping approximations are employed and/or when the heteroscedasticity of the model residual errors is ignored. Conversely, the use of robust numerics and more adequate (albeit still clearly imperfect) likelihood functions markedly stabilizes and, in many cases, reduces the time scale dependencies and improves the identifiability of increasingly complex model structures. Parameters describing slow flow remained essentially constant over the range of subhourly to daily scales considered here, while parameters describing quick flow converged toward increasingly precise and stable estimates as the data resolution approached the characteristic time scale of these faster processes. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations based on numerical error analysis and data-averaging considerations. Additional diagnostics confirmed the improved ability of the more complex models to reproduce distinct signatures in the observed data. More broadly, this study provides insights into the information content of hydrological data and, by advocating careful attention to robust numericostatistical analysis and stringent process-oriented diagnostics, furthers the utilization of dense-resolution data and experimental insights to advance hypothesis-based hydrological modeling at the catchment scale.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread use of conceptual hydrological models in environmental research and operations, they remain frequently implemented using numerically unreliable methods. This paper considers the impact of the time stepping scheme on model analysis (sensitivity analysis, parameter optimization, and Markov chain Monte Carlo-based uncertainty estimation) and prediction. It builds on the companion paper (Clark and Kavetski, 2010), which focused on numerical accuracy, fidelity, and computational efficiency. Empirical and theoretical analysis of eight distinct time stepping schemes for six different hydrological models in 13 diverse basins demonstrates several critical conclusions. (1) Unreliable time stepping schemes, in particular, fixed-step explicit methods, suffer from troublesome numerical artifacts that severely deform the objective function of the model. These deformations are not rare isolated instances but can arise in any model structure, in any catchment, and under common hydroclimatic conditions. (2) Sensitivity analysis can be severely contaminated by numerical errors, often to the extent that it becomes dominated by the sensitivity of truncation errors rather than the model equations. (3) Robust time stepping schemes generally produce “better behaved” objective functions, free of spurious local optima, and with sufficient numerical continuity to permit parameter optimization using efficient quasi Newton methods. When implemented within a multistart framework, modern Newton-type optimizers are robust even when started far from the optima and provide valuable diagnostic insights not directly available from evolutionary global optimizers. (4) Unreliable time stepping schemes lead to inconsistent and biased inferences of the model parameters and internal states. (5) Even when interactions between hydrological parameters and numerical errors provide “the right result for the wrong reason” and the calibrated model performance appears adequate, unreliable time stepping schemes make the model unnecessarily fragile in predictive mode, undermining validation assessments and operational use. Erroneous or misleading conclusions of model analysis and prediction arising from numerical artifacts in hydrological models are intolerable, especially given that robust numerics are accepted as mainstream in other areas of science and engineering. We hope that the vivid empirical findings will encourage the conceptual hydrological community to close its Pandora's box of numerical problems, paving the way for more meaningful model application and interpretation.},

This second paper specifies the model equations and their spatial approximations, describes the hydrologic and biophysical process parameterizations currently supported within the framework, and illustrates how the framework can be used in conjunction with multivariate observations to identify model improvements and future research and data needs. The case studies illustrate the use of {SUMMA} to select among competing modeling approaches based on both observed data and theoretical considerations. Specific examples of preferable modeling approaches include the use of physiological methods to estimate stomatal resistance, careful specification of the shape of the within-canopy and below-canopy wind profile, explicitly accounting for dust concentrations within the snowpack, and explicitly representing distributed lateral flow processes. Results also demonstrate that changes in parameter values can make as much or more difference to the model predictions than changes in the process representation. This emphasizes that improvements in model fidelity require a sagacious choice of both process parameterizations and model parameters. In conclusion, we envisage that {SUMMA} can facilitate ongoing model development efforts, the diagnosis and correction of model structural errors, and improved characterization of model uncertainty.},

	abstract = {We implemented the Amenu-Kumar model in the Community Land Model ({CLM}4.5) to simulate plant Root Hydraulic Redistribution ({RHR}) and analyzed its influence on {CLM} hydrology from site to global scales. We evaluated two numerical implementations: the first solved the coupled equations of root and soil water transport concurrently, while the second solved the two equations sequentially. Through sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that the sequentially coupled implementation ({SCI}) is numerically incorrect, whereas the tightly coupled implementation ({TCI}) is numerically robust with numerical time steps varying from 1 to 30 min. At the site-level, we found the {SCI} approach resulted in better agreement with measured evapotranspiration ({ET}) at the {AmeriFlux} Blodgett Forest site, California, whereas the two approaches resulted in equally poor agreement between predicted and measured {ET} at the {LBA} Tapajos {KM}67 Mature Forest site in Amazon, Brazil. Globally, the {SCI} approach overestimated annual land {ET} by as much as 3.5 mm d−1 in some grid cells when compared to the {TCI} estimates. These comparisons demonstrate that {TCI} is a more robust numerical implementation of {RHR}. However, we found, even with {TCI}, that incorporating {RHR} resulted in worse agreement with measured soil moisture at both the Blodgett Forest and Tapajos sites and degraded the agreement between simulated terrestrial water storage anomaly and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ({GRACE}) observations. We find including {RHR} in {CLM}4.5 improved {ET} predictions compared with the {FLUXNET}-{MTE} estimates north of 20° N but led to poorer predictions in the tropics. The biases in {ET} were robust and significant regardless of the four different pedotransfer functions or of the two meteorological forcing data sets we applied. We also found that the simulated water table was unrealistically sensitive to {RHR}. Therefore, we contend that further structural and data improvements are warranted to improve the hydrological dynamics in {CLM}4.5.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effects of irrigation on global water resources by performing and analyzing Community Land Model 4.0 ({CLM}4) simulations driven by downscaled/bias-corrected historical simulations and future projections from five General Circulation Models ({GCMs}). For each climate scenario, three sets of numerical experiments were performed: (1) a {CTRL} experiment in which all crops are assumed to be rainfed; (2) an {IRRIG} experiment in which the irrigation module is activated using surface water ({SW}) to feed irrigation; and (3) a {PUMP} experiment in which a groundwater pumping scheme coupled with the irrigation module is activated for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater ({GW}) for irrigation. The parameters associated with irrigation and groundwater pumping are calibrated based on a global inventory of census-based water use compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization ({FAO}). Our results suggest that irrigation could lead to two major effects: {SW} ({GW}) depletion in regions with irrigation primarily fed by {SW} ({GW}), respectively. Furthermore, irrigation depending primarily on {SW} tends to have larger impacts on low-flow than high-flow conditions, suggesting increased vulnerability to drought. By the end of the 21st century, combined effect of increased irrigation water demand and amplified temporal-spatial variability of water supply may lead to severe local water scarcity for irrigation. Regionally, irrigation has the potential to aggravate/alleviate climate-induced changes of {SW}/{GW} although such effects are negligible when averaged globally. Our study highlights the need to account for irrigation effects and sources in assessing regional climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {With the aim of developing a fully coupled atmosphere-hydrology model system, the Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) model was enhanced by integrating a new set of hydrologic physics parameterizations accounting for lateral water flow occurring at the land surface. The {WRF}-Hydro modeling system was applied for a 3 year long simulation in the Crati River Basin (Southern Italy), where output from the fully coupled {WRF}/{WRF}-Hydro was compared to that provided by original {WRF} model. Prior to performing coupled land-atmosphere simulations, the stand-alone hydrological model (“uncoupled” {WRF}-Hydro) was calibrated through an automated procedure and validated using observed meteorological forcing and streamflow data, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency value of 0.80 for 1 year of simulation. Precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, deep drainage, and land surface heat fluxes were compared between {WRF}-only and {WRF}/{WRF}-Hydro simulations and validated additionally with ground-based observations, a {FLUXNET} site, and {MODIS}-derived {LST}. Since the main rain events in the study area are mostly dependent on the interactions between the atmosphere and the surrounding Mediterranean Sea, changes in precipitation between modeling experiments were modest. However, redistribution and reinfiltration of local infiltration excess produced higher soil moisture content, lower overall surface runoff, and higher drainage in the fully coupled model. Higher soil moisture values in {WRF}/{WRF}-Hydro slightly influenced precipitation and also increased latent heat fluxes. Overall, the fully coupled model tended to show better performance with respect to observed precipitation while allowing more water to circulate in the modeled regional water cycle thus, ultimately, modifying long-term hydrological processes at the land surface.},

These developments are designed to address a known bias in {CABLE}: the excess simulation of mean evapotranspiration over most of the Northern Hemisphere and over most vegetation types at global scales. The inclusion of subgrid-scale soil moisture parameterizations and runoff generation processes largely mitigates the overestimation of evapotranspiration, and simultaneously improves the simulation of mean runoff. There are also pronounced improvements in total water storage anomalies as compared to various observationally derived estimates. It is shown that surface and subsurface runoff generation resulting from subgrid-scale soil moisture heterogeneity is necessary to accurately simulate the mean observed runoff and evapotranspiration. Surface runoff generation is largely responsible from reducing the mean evapotranspiration bias north of 30°N. We note that the inability of previous {CABLE} evaluation studies to demonstrate the need for subgrid-scale heterogeneity is likely due to only testing at flux tower site scales. Evaluating land models at point scale and catchment scale across a large range of climate and vegetation types is necessary to evaluate the contributions of processes that influence the model at various spatial scales. Flux tower data are therefore a necessary but insufficient constraint on land surface models.},

An urban canyon model is added and a transient land cover and land use change ({LCLUC}) capability, including wood harvest, is introduced, enabling study of historic and future {LCLUC} on energy, water, momentum, carbon, and nitrogen fluxes. The hydrology scheme is modified with a revised numerical solution of the Richards equation and a revised ground evaporation parameterization that accounts for litter and within-canopy stability. The new snow model incorporates the {SNow} and Ice Aerosol Radiation model ({SNICAR}) - which includes aerosol deposition, grain-size dependent snow aging, and vertically-resolved snowpack heating – as well as new snow cover and snow burial fraction parameterizations. The thermal and hydrologic properties of organic soil are accounted for and the ground column is extended to ∼50-m depth. Several other minor modifications to the land surface types dataset, grass and crop optical properties, surface layer thickness, roughness length and displacement height, and the disposition of snow-capped runoff are also incorporated. The new model exhibits higher snow cover, cooler soil temperatures in organic-rich soils, greater global river discharge, and lower albedos over forests and grasslands, all of which are improvements compared to {CLM}3.5. When {CLM}4 is run with {CN}, the mean biogeophysical simulation is degraded because the vegetation structure is prognostic rather than prescribed, though running in this mode also allows more complex terrestrial interactions with climate and climate change.},

Here we describe the composition of a new soil texture data set and its implementation into a specific land surface modeling system, namely, the Catchment land surface model ({LSM}) of the {NASA} Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 ({GEOS}-5) modeling and assimilation framework. First, global soil texture composites are generated using data from the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.21 ({HWSD}1.21) and the State Soil Geographic ({STATSGO}2) project, with explicit consideration of different levels of organic material. Then, the {LSM}'s soil parameters are upgraded using the new texture data, with hydraulic parameters derived for the more extensive set of texture classes using pedotransfer functions. Other changes to the {LSM} parameters are included to further support simulations at increasingly fine resolutions. A suite of simulations with the original and new parameter versions shows modest yet significant improvements in the Catchment {LSM}'s simulation of soil moisture and surface hydrological fluxes. The revised {LSM} parameters will be used for the forthcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive ({SMAP}) soil moisture assimilation product.},

	abstract = {Integrated hydrologic models coupled to land surface models link water and energy movement among the subsurface, land surface, and atmosphere. These connections are especially important when estimating a complex, nonlinear process like evaporation. A comprehensive sensitivity study of an evaporation parameterization was conducted using the integrated {ParFlow}-Common Land Model ({PF}-{CLM}). Estimates of ground evaporation using three forms of the same equation, two simplified closed-form solutions and one fully-coupled {PF}-{CLM} equation, are systematically compared. The parameterizations vary in complexity, coupling strength, and nonlinearity. Forcing data from three climate regions (alpine, plains, and tropical) are used to compare estimates of bare ground evaporation across all three formulations, thus exploring the process and coupling sensitivity in a novel way. The overall behavior of ground evaporation is consistent throughout the year for all parameterizations, but magnitudes vary with respect to parameterization complexity during energy-limited and water-limited times of the year. A relationship between ground evaporation and ground temperature is shown to exist across all climates and aggregate by pressure, wind speed, and air temperature in the plains climate. Furthermore, results show how increasing complexity through the addition of land surface conditions, atmospheric conditions, and atmospheric stability uniquely compound to influence the relationship between bare ground evaporation and subsurface pressure. Identification of sensitive interactions and unique relationships is necessary to further understand and predict hydrologic processes like evaporation.},

	abstract = {Preferential flow through weathered bedrock leads to rapid rise of the water table after the first rainstorms and significant water storage (also known as “rock moisture”) in the fractures. We present a new parameterization of hydraulic conductivity that captures the preferential flow and is easy to implement in global climate models. To mimic the naturally varying heterogeneity with depth in the subsurface, the model represents the hydraulic conductivity as a product of the effective saturation and a background hydraulic conductivity Kbkg, drawn from a lognormal distribution. The mean of the background Kbkg decreases monotonically with depth, while its variance reduces with the effective saturation. Model parameters are derived by assimilating into Richards’ equation 6 years of 30 min observations of precipitation (mm) and water table depths (m), from seven wells along a steep hillslope in the Eel River watershed in Northern California. The results show that the observed rapid penetration of precipitation and the fast rise of the water table from the well locations, after the first winter rains, are well captured with the new stochastic approach in contrast to the standard van Genuchten model of hydraulic conductivity, which requires significantly higher levels of saturated soils to produce the same results. “Rock moisture,” the moisture between the soil mantle and the water table, comprises 30\% of the moisture because of the great depth of the weathered bedrock layer and could be a potential source of moisture to sustain trees through extended dry periods. Furthermore, storage of moisture in the soil mantle is smaller, implying less surface runoff and less evaporation, with the proposed new model.},

However, current large-scale land models (as a component of Earth System Models, or {ESMs}) do not yet reflect the best hydrologic process understanding or utilize the large amount of hydrologic observations for model testing. This paper discusses the opportunities and key challenges to improve hydrologic process representations and benchmarking in {ESM} land models, suggesting that (1) land model development can benefit from recent advances in hydrology, both through incorporating key processes (e.g., groundwater-surface water interactions) and new approaches to describe multiscale spatial variability and hydrologic connectivity; (2) accelerating model advances requires comprehensive hydrologic benchmarking in order to systematically evaluate competing alternatives, understand model weaknesses, and prioritize model development needs, and (3) stronger collaboration is needed between the hydrology and {ESM} modeling communities, both through greater engagement of hydrologists in {ESM} land model development, and through rigorous evaluation of {ESM} hydrology performance in research watersheds or Critical Zone Observatories. Such coordinated efforts in advancing hydrology in {ESMs} have the potential to substantially impact energy, carbon, and nutrient cycle prediction capabilities through the fundamental role hydrologic processes play in regulating these cycles.},

	abstract = {The disaggregation of coarse precipitation products is desirable for spatially distributed hydrological applications where high-resolution rainfall fields are required. In this study, we generate an ensemble of satellite-based precipitation estimates using a spatiotemporal disaggregation framework for use in a spatially explicit hydrologic model. The framework effectively reproduced small, localized storm events using coarse precipitation estimates while simultaneously including known error characteristics into the precipitation fields. Ensemble precipitation inputs were propagated through a distributed hydrologic model to evaluate the impact on simulated hydrologic states and fluxes, such as streamflow, soil moisture content, and evapotranspiration. The disaggregation framework adds utility to the coarse satellite precipitation measurements by inducing a realistic hydrologic response in a manner similar to high-resolution ground-based radar observations. Errors introduced in the precipitation ensembles, namely, the overestimation of high-intensity, short-duration storm events, were tracked through the hydrological system, and physical mechanisms for the soil moisture and streamflow uncertainty are discussed. It was found that increases in streamflow magnitude and decreases in catchment area resulted in increased ensemble streamflow dispersion. In addition, precipitation uncertainty affected soil moisture predictions with more pronounced ensemble dispersion near the surface. Finally, spatial ensemble statistics were used to assess the precipitation and topographic control over soil moisture statistics in the study catchment.},

To better understand local impacts of regional climate change, we conducted model experiments to determine hydrologic sensitivities of annual, seasonal, and monthly runoff to imposed annual and seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature. We used the Variable Infiltration Capacity ({VIC}) land-surface hydrology model applied at 1/16° latitude-longitude spatial resolution over the Pacific Northwest ({PNW}), a scale sufficient to support analyses at the hydrologic unit code eight ({HUC}-8) basin level. These experiments resolve the spatial character of the sensitivity of future water supply to precipitation and temperature changes by identifying the seasons and locations where climate change will have the biggest impact on runoff. The {PNW} exhibited a diversity of responses, where transitional (intermediate elevation) watersheds experience the greatest seasonal shifts in runoff in response to cool season warming. We also developed a methodology that uses these hydrologic sensitivities as basin-specific transfer functions to estimate future changes in long-term mean monthly hydrographs directly from climate model output of precipitation and temperature. When principles of linearity and superposition apply, these transfer functions can provide feasible first-order estimates of the likely nature of future seasonal streamflow change without performing downscaling and detailed model simulations.},

	abstract = {Ambiguities in the representation of environmental processes have manifested themselves in a plethora of hydrological models, differing in almost every aspect of their conceptualization and implementation. The current overabundance of models is symptomatic of an insufficient scientific understanding of environmental dynamics at the catchment scale, which can be attributed to difficulties in measuring and representing the heterogeneity encountered in natural systems. This commentary advocates using the method of multiple working hypotheses for systematic and stringent testing of model alternatives in hydrology. We discuss how the multiple-hypothesis approach provides the flexibility to formulate alternative representations (hypotheses) describing both individual processes and the overall system. When combined with incisive diagnostics to scrutinize multiple model representations against observed data, this provides hydrologists with a powerful and systematic approach for model development and improvement. Multiple-hypothesis frameworks also support a broader coverage of the model hypothesis space and hence improve the quantification of predictive uncertainty arising from system and component nonidentifiabilities. As part of discussing the advantages and limitations of multiple-hypothesis frameworks, we critically review major contemporary challenges in hydrological hypothesis-testing, including exploiting different types of data to investigate the fidelity of alternative process representations, accounting for model structure ambiguities arising from major uncertainties in environmental data, quantifying regional differences in dominant hydrological processes, and the grander challenge of understanding the self-organization and optimality principles that may functionally explain and describe the heterogeneities evident in most environmental systems. We assess recent progress in these research directions, and how new advances are possible using multiple-hypothesis methodologies.},

	abstract = {The Common Land Model ({CLM}), which results from a 3-yr joint effort among seven land modeling groups, has been coupled with the National Center for Atmospheric Research ({NCAR}) Community Climate Model ({CCM}3). Two 15-yr simulations of {CCM}3 coupled with {CLM} and the {NCAR} Land Surface Model ({LSM}), respectively, are used to document the relative impact of {CLM} versus {LSM} on land surface climate. It is found that {CLM} significantly reduces the summer cold bias of surface air temperature in {LSM}, which is associated with higher sensible heat fluxes and lower latent heat fluxes in {CLM}, and the winter warm bias over seasonally snow-covered regions, especially in Eurasia. {CLM} also significantly improves the simulation of the annual cycle of runoff in {LSM}. In addition, {CLM} simulates the snow mass better than {LSM} during the snow accumulation stage. These improvements are primarily caused by the improved parameterizations in runoff, snow, and other processes (e.g., turbulence) in {CLM}. The new land boundary data (e.g., leaf-area index, fractional vegetation cover, albedo) also contribute to the improvement in surface air temperature simulation over some regions. Overall, {CLM} has little impact on precipitation and surface net radiative fluxes.},

	abstract = {The seasonal and annual climatological behavior of selected components of the hydrological cycle are presented from coupled and uncoupled configurations of the atmospheric component of the Community Climate System Model ({CCSM}) Community Atmosphere Model version 3 ({CAM}3). The formulations of processes that play a role in the hydrological cycle are significantly more complex when compared with earlier versions of the atmospheric model. Major features of the simulated hydrological cycle are compared against available observational data, and the strengths and weaknesses are discussed in the context of specified sea surface temperature and fully coupled model simulations. The magnitude of the {CAM}3 hydrological cycle is weaker than in earlier versions of the model, and is more consistent with observational estimates. Major features of the exchange of water with the surface, and the vertically integrated storage of water in the atmosphere, are generally well captured on seasonal and longer time scales. The water cycle response to {ENSO} events is also very realistic. The simulation, however, continues to exhibit a number of long-standing biases, such as a tendency to produce double {ITCZ}-like structures in the deep Tropics, and to overestimate precipitation rates poleward of the extratropical storm tracks. The lower-tropospheric dry bias, associated with the parameterized treatment of convection, also remains a simulation deficiency. Several of these biases are exacerbated when the atmosphere is coupled to fully interactive surface models, although the larger-scale behavior of the hydrological cycle remains nearly identical to simulations with prescribed distributions of sea surface temperature and sea ice.},

	abstract = {Because of a lack of observations, historical simulations of land surface conditions using land surface models are needed for studying variability and changes in the continental water cycle and for providing initial conditions for seasonal climate predictions. Atmospheric forcing datasets are also needed for land surface model development. The quality of atmospheric forcing data greatly affects the ability of land surface models to realistically simulate land surface conditions. Here a carefully constructed global forcing dataset for 1948–2004 with 3-hourly and T62 (∼1.875°) resolution is described, and historical simulations using the latest version of the Community Land Model version 3.0 ({CLM}3) are evaluated using available observations of streamflow, continental freshwater discharge, surface runoff, and soil moisture. The forcing dataset was derived by combining observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation and surface air temperature with intramonthly variations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research ({NCEP}–{NCAR}) reanalysis, which is shown to have spurious trends and biases in surface temperature and precipitation. Surface downward solar radiation from the reanalysis was first adjusted for variations and trends using monthly station records of cloud cover anomaly and then for mean biases using satellite observations during recent decades. Surface specific humidity from the reanalysis was adjusted using the adjusted surface air temperature and reanalysis relative humidity. Surface wind speed and air pressure were interpolated directly from the 6-hourly reanalysis data. Sensitivity experiments show that the precipitation adjustment (to the reanalysis data) leads to the largest improvement, while the temperature and radiation adjustments have only small effects. When forced by this dataset, the {CLM}3 reproduces many aspects of the long-term mean, annual cycle, interannual and decadal variations, and trends of streamflow for many large rivers (e.g., the Orinoco, Changjiang, Mississippi, etc.), although substantial biases exist. The simulated long-term-mean freshwater discharge into the global and individual oceans is comparable to 921 river-based observational estimates. Observed soil moisture variations over Illinois and parts of Eurasia are generally simulated well, with the dominant influence coming from precipitation. The results suggest that the {CLM}3 simulations are useful for climate change analysis. It is also shown that unrealistically low intensity and high frequency of precipitation, as in most model-simulated precipitation or observed time-averaged fields, result in too much evaporation and too little runoff, which leads to lower than observed river flows. This problem can be reduced by adjusting the precipitation rates using observed-precipitation frequency maps.},
